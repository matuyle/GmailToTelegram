# Gmail to Telegram: Automate Important Email Alerts Using AI and Google Apps Script

## What It Is

This project is a simple automation that sends instant Telegram notifications when you receive important emails in Gmail, using Google Apps Script and the help of AI tools. It‚Äôs ideal for anyone who gets too many emails and wants to focus only on the ones that really matter‚Äîwithout constantly checking their inbox or being distracted by unnecessary notifications.

**Key Features:**
- Instantly alerts you in Telegram for only the emails you care about.
- Lets you control notifications for just one Telegram chat.
- Runs for free and entirely within your own Google account‚Äîno paid subscriptions or extra servers.
- Customizable: You can change which emails trigger alerts and how messages are sent.

## How It Works

1. **Google Apps Script Checks Gmail**  
   - The script scans your Gmail for new, unread messages.
   - It looks for emails that match your rules‚Äîeither from specific senders (like your boss or key team members) or containing certain subject keywords (like "Project Status Update").

2. **Sends Important Alerts to Telegram**  
   - When a matching email arrives, the script sends a notification straight into your chosen Telegram chat (via a custom Telegram bot).
   - Each alert includes a clickable link so you can jump directly to the email.

3. **Organizes Your Inbox**  
   - The script labels and marks those emails as read so you don‚Äôt get repeated notifications for the same message.

4. **Runs Automatically, No Extra Hosting**  
   - Everything runs within your Google account, completely free and with no external servers required.
   - You can customize the logic at any time to add more sender addresses or topics, or tweak how the messages appear in Telegram.

## Typical Workflow Example

- **Step 1:** Set up Google Apps Script to monitor Gmail.
- **Step 2:** Define your notification rules (specific senders, keywords, etc.).
- **Step 3:** Connect your Telegram account and set up a bot to receive messages.
- **Step 4:** Whenever a matching email arrives, you get a Telegram alert‚Äîincluding a link to view the email directly.
- **Step 5:** Stay productive! No need to refresh your inbox or get interrupted by every message‚Äîonly the important ones.
